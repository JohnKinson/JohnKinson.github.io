        <h2>What is Beam? </h2>
        <p>Beam Films is a film distribution company that not only acquires films through traditional distribution channels but also uses our platform to accept submissions from Independent Filmmakers to release their films through our company. Through our curation process, we pick the films that best have the technical and artistic qualities that fit with the tastes and philosophies of the company. Our goal is to allow every filmmaker a specific opportunity to get access to high quality marketing and distribution. However, due to over-saturation and a wide range of quality films, curation is necessary to highlight the best possible films with unique stories and interesting filmmaking techniques.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>To champion bold, boundary-pushing cinema and empower visionary filmmakers. We believe in the transformative power of storytelling and its ability to connect diverse audiences across cultures. Our commitment is to curate and distribute films that challenge conventions, spark conversations, and leave a lasting impact. By fostering creativity, embracing risk, and nurturing emerging talent, we aim to redefine the cinematic landscape and elevate the art of storytelling.</p>
